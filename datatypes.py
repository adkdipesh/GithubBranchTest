# Every value in Python has a datatype. Since everything is an object in Python programming, data types are actually classes and variables are instance (object) of these classes.

# Built-in data types in python

# int, float, complex
# str
# list, tuple, range
# set, dict
# bool - True, False



# Practice

#int type
a = 5
b = 10000
c = 123456789
print(a,b,c)

#float type
a = 5.55567
b = 3.0
c = 55
print(a,b,c)

#complex type
a = complex(5,6)
b = complex(1.11,9.999)
c = complex(99,100.00)
print(a,b,c)

#string type
a = 'This is string type'
b = "I'm also string"
c = '''I'm another string"type'''
print(a)
print(b)
print(c)
